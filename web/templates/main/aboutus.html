            <h3>How we started.</h3>
            <p>In 2009, with only $ 1000 Moffat Osoro started a medical facility (FreMo) and was joined two years later by his brother (Fred) to offer affordable, quality and accessible Medicare to the people of Kawangware informal settlement. It was a big
                task taking into consideration that Moffat had no academic backing in medical. The centre has now attracted global attention for its better and gentle care to families and women seeking better maternal care.In June 2011 Moffat was joined
                by Australian Midwife Vicki Chan and together with Fred established the gentle care culture of birthing at the beautiful centre. </p>

                            <p>We envisage a world where each woman is nurtured, heard, and valued and has the information, resources, confidence, and support she requires to achieve the best possible pregnancy, birth, and mothering experience. In such a
                                world, her baby would be born with a fair and equal chance at life and love.
